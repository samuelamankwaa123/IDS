Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated/versions/49

Authors: Sandra Schihalejev, Samuel Amankwaa, Merilin Radvilavicius

**MOTIVATION AND GOAL**

Motivation:
1. Help increase artists' success on the platform
2. Aid Spotify in curating more engaging playlists

Goals:

1. To gain insights into what makes a song popular on Spotify. This can help artists, producers, and record labels tailor their music to audience preferences, increasing the likelihood of success on the platform. Additionally, the insights could aid Spotify in curating more engaging playlists and recommending songs that align with user preferences.
2. To develop predictive models that can forecast the future popularity of songs. This could be a game-changer for the industry, allowing stakeholders to anticipate market trends and adapt accordingly. Such models would be instrumental in guiding decisions related to album releases, concert planning, and even long-term artist development strategies.

**GUIDE TO THE CONTENTS**

The respository consists 4 files:
1. the poster
2. the report that was due December 4,
3. the Jupyter Notebook file for the project: visualizations, statistics, modelling, conclusions, and
4. README.md file for the description of the project

The analysis can be replicated by for example changing randm_state values and running the Notebook file again ("Run & Restart All").
